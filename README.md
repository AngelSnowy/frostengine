# crapengine!!!

 i mean the title says it all xd. its single threaded, but still performs pretty well.
 
 its written in plain cpp20 and x11 to draw indiviual pixels to a window. the rest is entirely made from scratch.
 
 # features
 
  - obj file loading to visualize models ( big models require a fast clock speed cpu. otherwise rendering slows down )
  - 3 dof model transformation
  - 3 dof camera movement and "jet" style camera
  - *VERY* simple face shading
  
# to do:

 - texture rendering
 - face clipping
 - redo movement system
 - abstract everything
 - oop based model loader
 
# to do (far in the future lol):
 
 - ray tracing xdddd
 - lighting engine
 - animation loader
 - physics / collission engine
