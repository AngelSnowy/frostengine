# frostengine!!!

 Its an engine!!! It works, its single threaded, but still performs pretty well ngl.
 
 its written in plain cpp20 and x11 to draw indiviual pixels to a window. the rest is entirely made from scratch.
 
 # features
 
  - obj file loading to visualize models ( big models require a fast clock speed cpu. otherwise rendering slows down )
  - double buffering
  - abstracted and easy to use model loading and positioning (oop!!!! omg i love oop!!!)
  - 3 dof model transformation (per model)
  - 3 dof camera movement and "jet" style camera
  - *VERY* simple face shading
  
# to do:

 - texture rendering
 - abstract everything
 - advanced shading / lighting engine
 
# to do (far in the future lol):
 
 - ray tracing xdddd
 - lighting engine
 - animation loader
 - physics / collission engine
